23. **Access_Control_Propagation:** 
    - Refers to whether access control policies propagate through different layers of the system (TRUE/FALSE).

24. **API_Access_Control:** 
    - Specifies if there are specific access control measures for APIs (TRUE/FALSE).

25. **Cloud_Workload_Identity:** 
    - Ensures that workloads in the cloud are given appropriate identities for security purposes (TRUE/FALSE).

26. **Audit_Trails:** 
    - Indicates if the system maintains audit logs for activities (TRUE/FALSE).

27. **Access_Revocation:** 
    - Describes whether access can be revoked when necessary (TRUE/FALSE).

28. **Cross_Region_Access:** 
    - Shows if cross-region access is allowed (TRUE/FALSE).

29. **DLP_Policies:** 
    - Describes if Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies are implemented (TRUE/FALSE).

30. **Multi_Tenancy_Security:** 
    - Refers to whether there are security mechanisms in place for a multi-tenant environment (TRUE/FALSE).

31. **Cloud_Orchestration_Layer_Security:** 
    - Indicates if there are specific security measures for the cloud orchestration layer (TRUE/FALSE).

32. **Token_Based_Access_Control:** 
    - Specifies if access control is based on tokens (TRUE/FALSE).

### **Example Rows:**
- The first row corresponds to a system with Biometric authentication, Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), managed user identities, high privileges (Admin), and adherence to various security and compliance measures on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with location restrictions (US).
  
- The second row shows a system using Biometric authentication, Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), with Write access for Guest users, and hosted on IBM Cloud with similar but slightly different security measures. 

These fields represent a highly detailed structure for managing security, access control, compliance, and cloud-based services. This kind of database can be used for managing and assessing security controls, policies, and compliance across different cloud or IT infrastructures.''')
